             Specialty coffee can consistently exist through the
             dedication of the people who have made it their 
             life's work to continually make quality their highest priority. 
             This is not the work of only one person in the lifecycle of a coffee bean;
             specialty can only occur when all of those involved in the coffee value
             chain work in harmony and maintain a keen focus on standards and excellence 
             from start to finish. This is no easy accomplishment, and yet because of 
             these dedicated professionals, there are numerous specialty coffees available
             right now, across the globe, and likely right around the corner from you.
